## Features

MUI Spacer is a wrapper around a MUI Divider component.  It adds space between components by creating a Divider with no border or any other visible feature.

## Implementation

Install the Spacer:

```
npm install @jon20111/mui-spacer
```

Import the Spacer:
```js
import Spacer from '@jon20111/mui-spacer'
```
Props:
It can receive all Divider props, as well as a 'space' prop.

The space prop takes a string px value and uses that to size the Spacer.
